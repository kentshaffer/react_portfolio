      Hello, my name is Kent Shaffer. I have recently joined the growing population of
      developers. I am a student in the UCSD extension coding bootcamp and will complete
      the program in November of 2022. I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
      So far I have been learning and experimenting with website creation, but am extremely
      excited to see how far I can really go in the world of developing.
