# React Portfolio

## Module 20: React

Created a React.js portfolio to serve as a sample of my development ability for future employers, clients, or teammates, as well as act as a contact point for any interested parties to get in touch. The portfolio showcases React skill in the construction of the portfolio app itself, as well as showing past projects that use additional technologies.

## About the author:

My name is Kent Shaffer and I am a recent graduate of UCSD's full stack web development bootcamp. Prior to starting the program I had zero code experience, so it feels I've been drinking in new information through a fire hose, but I have been loving learning, and I'm excited about all the possibilities that live within the scope of the technologies I have been learning.

If you have any questions, or would like to get in contact, I can be reached at kentshaff@gmail.com
